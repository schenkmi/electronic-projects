# STM32F4 24 Pin Rev E

23xx (STM32F4 24 pin) ROM replacement SDRR PCB.

This revision has four key improvements over rev D:

- STM32F405 and STM32F415 variants are now supported - note there are some BOM differences between the F401/F411 and F405/F415 variants.  (F415 has not been tested, but is pin compatible with the F405 which has been.)
- No 0402 passives are used - all passives are 0603, which is easier to hand solder.  The PCB footprint remains the same.
- Additional image select jumper (4th jumper => allows up to 16 images/sets to be selected).
- Status LED.

## Ordering Bare PCBs

[![Order from OSH Park](https://oshpark.c   om/assets/badge-5b7ec47045b78aef6eb9d83b3bac6b1920de805e9a0c227658eac6e19a045b9c.png)](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/9TJoAirm)

## Errata

All corrections have been reflected in the BOM below, but not the schematic or gerbers.

- **U3** recommend using AP2112K-3.3 in place of the RT9013, to reduce switching noise, which can cause failure to boot on some systems.

## Notes

- **F401/411/446 vs F405/F415 have slightly different [BOMs](#bom)**
- Now supports STM32F405 and STM32F415 variants, in addition to the STM32F401 and STM32F411 variants.
- Includes [status LED](/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#status_led).
- All passives are 0603, making it easier to hand solder.

## Changelog

- Consolidated and improved 401/411 vs 405/415 support - all variants are supported on the same board with minimal component changes required between variants.
- All passives are 0603.
- Renumbered components.
- Corrected VCAP_1 value for F401/F411 to 4.7uF (2.2uF causes F411 to lock up at 100MHz).
- Removed pull-downs on image select pins, to reduce component count (device uses internal pull-downs).
- Power LED replaced with status LED driven by PB15.
- Added 4th image select jumper (PB7), allowing up to 16 images to be selected.
- Limited silk-screen markings are provided.
