# One ROM Frequently Asked Questions

## What is One ROM?

**Q: What exactly is One ROM?**

A: One ROM is a ROM replacement solution that uses a cheap RP2350 or STM32F4 microcontroller to emulate failed or missing ROMs in retro computers. It is easily reprogrammed, can store up to 16 different ROM images and switch between them using jumpers, eliminating the need for expensive EEPROM programmers or multiple physical ROM chips.

**Q: What is Software Defined Retro ROM (SDRR)?**

A: The old name for One ROM.  While it captures the technical essence of One ROM, it wasn't exactly catchy.

**Q: Why would I use One ROM instead of buying replacement ROMs or using an EEPROM?**

A: One ROM offers several advantages:

- Much cheaper to program than xEPROMs ($5 programmer vs $40+ for xEPROM programmers).
- Fits the exact footprint of original ROMs, no overhanging the socket.
- Can be reprogrammed in-situ without removal, allowing sub-minute times to recompile and reflash firmware.
- Stores multiple images.
- Can support all required chip select line behaviours without any hardware changes.
- Is faster to build and program (just `make run` vs complex xEPROM procedures).
- Makes it easy to download and combine ROM images from various sources - no need to build combination ROM images by hand.
- Have various advanced features, such as boot time and dynamic image selection, and the ability to serve multi ROM sockets from a single ROM. 

**Q: What ROM types does One ROM support?**

A: One ROM currently emulates 2364 (8KB), 2332 (4KB), and 2316 (2KB) ROMs commonly used in Commodore systems, disk drives, and other retro computers.

The original ROMs had mask programmable chip select behaviour, which meant they could be either low or high when selected. One ROM can emulate this by configuring the chip select lines in software, allowing it to work with any system that uses these ROM types - and can support multiple images with different chip select configurations in a single firmware build.

## Hardware Compatibility

**Q: Which MCU variants are supported?**

A: Currently supported variants include:

- Raspberry Pi RP2350 (A4 stepping, 150Mhz max clock, 8 ROM images)
- STM32F401RBT6/RCT6/RET6 (84MHz max clock, 6-16 ROM images)
- STM32F411RCT6/RET6 (100MHz max clock, 14-16 ROM images)  
- STM32F405RGT6 (168MHz max clock, 16 ROM images)
- STM32F446RCT6/RETx (180MHz max clock, 16 ROM images)

The RP2350/F405/F446 are recommended for maximum compatibility as they runs fastest and supports the maximum number of target systems.

Note all MCUs are overclockable.

See [Supported Microcontrollers](/docs/MCU-SELECTION.md) for more details.

**Q: What retro systems work with One ROM?**

A: Tested systems include Commodore PETs, VIC-20s, C64s, TI-99, 1541 drives, and IEEE-488 drives. The F405 variant running at 168MHz should support virtually any system using compatible ROM types, including faster 2MHz systems.

If One ROM **doesn't** work in your system, replacing a 2364, 2332 or 2316, we want to hear about it!  Please [raise an issue](/README.md#debugging).

**Q: How do I know which MCU variant I need?**

A: Choose based on your target system's timing requirements. PETs need 26MHz minimum, VIC-20s need 37MHz, C64 kernals need 75MHz, and C64 character ROMs need 98MHz.

Use RP2350, F405 or F446 if unsure - they support all target systems.

See [MCU Selection](/docs/MCU-SELECTION.md) for more details.

**Q: Why are you using the STM32's internal oscillator - doesn't that make it unstable?**

A: An internal oscillator was one of the microcontroller selection criteria, in order to simplify the design, and reduce the PCB footprint and BOM cost.  The STM32F4 runs stably off its internal oscillator, although its accuracy is not as good as from an external crystal.  A precisely accurate clock is not required for this application - it primarily requires raw speed.

**Q: Why can't I find the MCU for $2?**

A: You need to look at Chinese sites including [aliexpress.com](https://www.aliexpress.com) and [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com), JLC PCB's component supplier ARM.

As of July 2025:

- LCSC wanted $1.74 for a single RP2350.
- LCSC had STM32F401 for $1.93 in quantities of 1 - good enough for PET, VIC-20 and C64 single ROMs
- LCSC had STM32F411 for $2.69 in quantities of 1 - also good enough for C64 multi-ROM sets
- aliexpress had STM32F405 for $3.08 in quantities of 1 - faster than the F401/F411
- aliexpress had GD32F405 $2.27 in quantities of 1 - GigaDevices produces clones of the STM32 parts

The aliexpress seller referred to above was also offering free shipping when buying more than 4 or 5 parts.

One ROM is extremely flexible in the STM32F4xxR variants it supports, so you can choose the cheapest one that meets your requirements.

**Q: Are STM32 clones just as good as the real deal STM32?**

A: Mostly, but not entirely.  The GigaDevices GD32F405 may take longer to boot than the STM32F405, but generally appears more performantSee [STM32 Clones](/docs/STM32-CLONES.md) for more details.

## Installation and Setup

**Q: What do I need to get started?**

A: You need:

- One ROM PCB
- a supported microcontroller
- some other components (voltage regulator, LED, resistors and capacitors)
- ARM GNU toolchain, Rust, probe-rs
- and an SWD programmer (ST-Link, Pi Debug Probe, or programmed Pi Pico).

See the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Q: How difficult is the PCB assembly?**

A: Depends on the board.

STM32 - Medium difficulty - some experience with surface mount soldering is recommended.

The rev D PCB uses a combination of 0402 and 0603 components.

Rev E/F PCBs uses all 0603 components, so are easier to solder.

All variants use an STM32 LQFP64 package, which requires soldering as it is close to other components.

RP2350 - High difficulty.  Recommend getting these assembled.

**Q: Can I use a Raspberry Pi Pico as a programmer?**

A: Yes! Flash the debug probe firmware to a Pi Pico and connect CLK (GP2), DIO (GP3), GND, and optionally 5V (VBUS). This provides a $5 programming solution.

See the [Pi Pico Programmer Guide](/docs/PI-PICO-PROGRAMMER.md) for detailed instructions.

## Programming and Flashing

**Q: How do I flash firmware to One ROM?**

A: Connect your programmer's CLK, DIO, and GND lines to One ROM, then run a command like this:

```bash
MCU=f411re CONFIG=config/c64.mk make run
```

This automatically downloads ROMs, generates firmware, and flashes the device.

There are other pre-collated collections of ROMs available in the [`config/`](/config/) directory, such as `vic20-pal.mk`, `pet-4-40-50.mk`, and `1541.mk`. You can also create your own custom configurations.

**Q: Can I reprogram One ROM while it's installed in my retro system?**

A: Yes! You can flash in-situ with the system powered on. The system may crash during flashing but will work normally after completion.

**Never** externally power One ROM when installed in a retro system.

**Q: What if I have flashing problems?**

A:

STM32: Jump the BOOT0 pin to 3.3V and power cycle to force bootloader mode, then reflash. Alternatively, enable the `BOOTLOADER` config option to enter bootloader mode when all image select jumpers are closed.

See the [Programming Guide](/docs/PROGRAMMING.md) for more details.

RP2350: Jump the BOOT pin to GND and power cycle to force bootloader mode, then reflash.

**Q: How can I see what platform in my firmware image is for?**

A: You can use [`sdrr-info`](/rust/sdrr-info/README.md) to inspect firmware `.elf` and `.bin` files.

**Q: How can I see what ROMs are in my firmware image?**

A: You can use [`sdrr-info`](/rust/sdrr-info/README.md) to inspect firmware `.elf` and `.bin` files.

## Configuration and Usage

**Q: How do I select which ROM image to use?**

A: Use the image select jumpers labeled 1, 2, 4, and 8 on the PCB bottom.  Close jumpers to form a binary number (0-15) corresponding to your desired ROM image.  A closed jumper corresponds to 1, an open jumper 0.

You must reboot One ROM after changing jumpers.

**Q: How many ROM images can I store?**

A: Up to 16 images, limited by either flash size (smaller variants) or the physical jumper count. Each image consumes 16KB of flash regardless of actual ROM size.

**Q: Can I mix different ROM types in one firmware?**

A: Yes! Each ROM image can be independently configured as 2364, 2332, or 2316 with different chip select configurations. See the [config files](/config/) for examples.

**Q: How do I create custom ROM configurations?**

A: Define `ROM_CONFIGS` with file paths, ROM types, and chip select settings:

```bash
ROM_CONFIGS=file=kernal.rom,type=2364,cs1=0 file=basic.rom,type=2364,cs1=0
```

Or create your own [config file](/config/).

## Performance and Technical

**Q: Can you add feature X to One ROM?**

A: Perhaps - raise an issue on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/software-defined-retro-rom/issues).

One ROM is very busy serving ROM images, so has few spare cycles for additional features.  However, it can be augmented by a co-processor such as [Airfrog](https://piers.rocks/u/airfrog) to provide additional functionality, such as remote access and control, or telemetry.  The RP2350 is likely to get additional features, on-board, due to its second core.

**Q: Why does One ROM store all ROM images as 16KB in flash?**

A: This optimization allows the main loop to use chip select states as direct address offsets, eliminating runtime calculations and achieving the required access speeds.

See [Technical Details](/docs/TECHNICAL-DETAILS.md) for more information.

**Q: What makes One ROM fast enough for retro systems?**

A: Multiple optimizations: maximum clock speeds, highly optimised assembly main loop, preloaded ROM data in RAM, no interrupts, flash prefetch/caching, and "mangled" ROM storage that matches the PCB pin mapping.

See [Technical Details](/docs/TECHNICAL-DETAILS.md) for more information.

**Q: Why not use interrupts?**

A: Interrupts would add latency that could cause the system to miss critical timing windows. The polling-based approach ensures consistent, predictable response times.  As One ROM does nothing other than serve flash, a tight main loop with no interrupts is sufficient **and** optimal.

**Q: Isn't the RP2350/STM32 a 3.3V device? How does it work in 5V systems?**

A: Most of the GPIO pins on the RP2350/STM32F4xx are 5V tolerant, and the maximum and minimum input and output voltage levels are compatible with the main target retro driving ICs (such as the 6502, VIC and VIC-II) chips.  Care is taken to ensure that only 5V tolerant GPIOs are used, including setting the drive strength on the STM32 to stay within the required output levels.

There's a detailed analysis in [Voltage Levels](/docs/VOLTAGE-LEVELS.md).

**Q: What languages are used in One ROM?**

A: The main [`sdrr`](/sdrr/) firmware is written in a combination of C and assembly.  Assembly is used for the main loop to achieve the required performance, while C is used for the startup-up logic.

C was chosen above other lanuages in order to stay as close as possible to the hardware, for performance reasons.  The C code is fully bare-metal - no hardware abstraction layer or other libraries are used, except [SEGGER-RTT](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/segger-rtt) for logging.

The [`sdrr-gen`](/rust/sdrr-gen/README.md) tool, which generates the ROM images and other code to embed in the main firmware is written in Rust.

**Q: What does the build pipeline look like.**

```ascii
User Input → Top-level Make → sdrr-gen → sdrr Make → sdrr-info → test (optional) → probe-rs → STM32
    ↓              ↓            ↓          ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓        ↓

```

See [Build System](/docs/BUILD-SYSTEM.md) for more details on how the build system works.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: How do I debug One ROM issues?**

A: Enable boot logging (default) to see startup information via SWD/RTT. This shows hardware info, ROM configurations, frequency settings, and which image is loaded. Boot logging adds ~1.5ms to startup time.

See [Logging](/docs/LOGGING.md) for more details.

**Q: My retro system doesn't boot with One ROM installed. What should I check?**

A: Verify the correct ROM type and chip select configuration, ensure One ROM is fully seated in the socket, check that the STM32 variant can run fast enough for your system, and review boot logs for errors.

It would be worth reprogramming One ROM with your firmware image in-situ, and viewing the logs to ensure the expected ROM image is being served.

See [`BOOT_LOGGING`](/docs/LOGGING.md#boot_logging) for more details on how to interpret boot logging.

**Q: Can I reduce power consumption?**

A: Lower the clock frequency using the `FREQ` option, disable the status LED with `STATUS_LED=0`, or choose a lower-power STM32 variant if it meets your timing requirements.

[Clock Speed Requirements](/docs/STM32-SELECTION.md#clock-speed-requirements) provides guidance on selecting the right frequency for your system, but you may need to experiment to find the best balance between performance and power consumption.

## Cost and Availability

**Q: How much does One ROM cost to build?**

A: In small quantities, expect around $5 per device.  The STM32F4 costs around $2 depending on variant, PCB manufacturing is inexpensive (2-layer, single-side components), and the BOM is minimal.

**Q: Where can I get the PCB?**

A: Order the latest revision from [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) using the provided link for your chosen revision in the [`sdrr-pcb`](/sdrr-pcb/README.md), or manufacture using the open-source design files.  We use JLC PCB to assemble our One ROMs, and are very happy with their service.

**Q: Is One ROM open source?**

A: Yes! Software/firmware uses MIT license, hardware uses CC BY-SA 4.0. You can modify, improve, and share the designs within the license terms.

**Q: Is there a warranty?**

A: In common with most open source projects, no warranty is provided.  See [License](/LICENSE.md) for details.  The project is provided "as is" without any guarantees of fitness for purpose or reliability.

However, if you find a bug or issue, please raise an issue via GitHub.
